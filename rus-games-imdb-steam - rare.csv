Where are the gnomes coming from? Play the game to find out! ✔ MAKE JELLY CANDIES Who are these cute little shapeless jellies? Who cares? Stuff them into your factory right away to get super-tasty candies! First gnome’s barely arrived, and here’s a second one already! Without even asking permission, the entire line grabs your candy one by one and rushes off in all directions. Simple persuasion is unlikely to get them to leave. You need strong defenses and proven tactics! ✔ TRICKY GNOME THIEVES These gnomes will do anything to get your candy. Smash them, throw them, zap them – do whatever it takes! Nah, none of this is fatal. The creatures pouring out of the portals are just soap replicas of the little misers, who want to cram their storehouses full of sweet caramel candies. So they’re taking them from you. Without asking! ✔ ASSEMBLE ASSORTED TRAPS So why do you need metal parts? That’s right – to assemble ingenious traps, bait, and even guns. All in the name of anti-gnome defense! And these won’t just prevent the gnomes from stealing your goodies – they’ll also teach them not to take things from someone else without asking! The key is to understand the tactics and strategy of the game. Everyone has their own style – including you! ✔ STUNNING GRAPHICS The beautiful details of the gnome world come alive at your fingertips. A colorful adventure awaits. Hurry – this puzzle isn’t solving itself! The game contains beautiful high-quality 3D visuals. We decided to implement not just interesting gameplay but beautiful, colorful worlds that both adults and kids would love. ✔ EPIC BOSS BATTLES This fairy tale world will be appreciated by kids and adults alike. And the best part is when a huge strange creature suddenly appears on the screen – a boss! Ah... so you haven’t bumped into a boss yet? You can be sure they’ll be the most difficult challenge you will face. ✔ IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE MYSTERIOUS STORY OF THE GNOMES What a mess! Our hero’s grandfather has gone missing, and a terrible disease spreads across the gnome world. What if this is all connected? Find out more about what happened... and fix it!","You inherit a strange box that is actually an interdimensional candy factory. How did this happen? Where are the gnomes coming from?

The old ways are gone – ground into dust by the powerful Maelstrom – and rising from the ashes are six powerful factions, vying for control over the ravaged landscape under the Dome.

If you’re a smart likeable character (with a high charisma rating) you might be able to talk your way out of things. But more likely it’s time for a bit of ultra-violence. And that means weapons; lots of weapons. And there’s no shortage of choice: from high tech beam weapons through to a solid right hook, there’s loads of way to bring down a hostile group of foes. Of course, you can be a pacifist and use non-lethal force but that’s a story for another day…<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/921800/extras/Encased-GIF_Companions.gif?t=1669389314"" /><br><br>The hostile and unforgiving world can be a lonely place; so why not team up with some like-minded individuals and face the challenges together. From hardened criminals built like mountains or scientists with a shady past, there’s a host of different potential companions to journey with, each replete with their own unique personality and skills. <br><br>Or you can just go “Lone Wolf” and face everything alone; it’s not an easy road but you can play this way too if you so wish.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/921800/extras/Encased-GIF_Choices.gif?t=1669389314"" /><br><br>Encased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join and how honourable a person you are.

The new, story-driven campaign lets you taste the explosive mix of the jungle, Hueys and rock-n-roll in 1968. The US campaign focuses on a team of elite special ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit includes Sergeant John Merrill, machine-gunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops. The North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one – they have no means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it’s too far to make it there on foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet offensive. Missions range from special operations (rescuing a shot-down pilot, escorting a reporter, etc.) to full scale battles. Key Features There are two sides in every story, so two new story-driven campaigns attempt to show the war from both sides. Breathtaking missions including an ambush on the Ho Chi Minh trail, a game of cat and mouse in the Mekong Delta, raids into Cambodia and Laos, bridge defense during the Tet offensive and more. New weapons and units: M-16, T-54, M-113, Patton III, M-60, AK-47, M-14, RPG-2, M-72 LAW, RPK and many more. Multiplayer mode – co-op for up to 4 players.

37000,Тургор,The Void,"Dec 15, 2009",0.0,9.99,1.0,"When a person’s soul is extinguished, for a brief flickering moment it passes The Void—a grey limbo, breathed back to life by scarce droplets of Color scattered across it. Ravenous, monstrous Brothers beckon the soul to preserve every bit of it; enticing, sly Sisters beg to be fed. The whole Void, inhabited also by a multitude of weird and sometimes scary creatures, changes with every droplet of Color used, making every action you take have repercussions across the whole world. But perhaps there is another way to use the Color. The way to break out of the never-ending cycle of the Void. Nourishing Color in gardens and fighting the Void’s creatures, unlocking the Sisters’ hearts and taking on their Brothers, the player gets the chance to find it… and achieve ultimate transcendence. Explore the Void. Broken into 29 separate chambers, the place you have fallen into is full of secrets, twists, and turns. Nourish, hunt, mine. Each type of environment offers its own features: grow Color in some, hunt for it or mine it in others, unlocking new chambers through the Sisters. Draw your soul. All important actions in the game are executed through drawing on the screen, the effect depending both on the sigil drawn and the color used. Get to know the Sisters. Each of them representing a combination of two Colors, each of them alluring and greedy, the Sisters are willing to spill their hearts out—if you fill them with Color first. Obey… or disobey. Seeing you as one of their own, the grotesque Brothers are willing to share their wisdom—as long as you obey. And if you don’t, be prepared for hard fights with intimidating gigantic foes. Gaze long into the Void and feel it gaze into you. The only resource in the game, Color changes both you and the world around you with every droplet used. Accumulating Red inside your heart can make you strong, but it also makes predators more aggressive; find the perfect balance or just watch the world react to every choice of yours. Listen to the Voice of Color and find your true purpose.

In classic mode, you fly a plane from the Second World War and fight in the air with the same. From weapons you have a machine gun, which has a high rate of fire, but with less damage and explosive shells, which are slower in rate of fire, but with high damage.<br />
<br />
In modern mode, you control a modern fighter and fight in the air with the same. From weapons you have a machine gun and two types of missiles. The first type of missiles has ammunition capacity limited to two pieces, but they have high damage and high aiming accuracy. The second type of missiles has a limited ammunition capacity of ten, but they have less damage and low targeting accuracy. You also have heat traps to trick the missiles flying at you.<br />

In invasion mode, you fight against space invaders in a modern fighter. Here you will not have to fight against the exterminators, because you have one goal - to expel the invaders.<br />

2099990,Graveyard Keeper,graveyard keeper,"{'coming_soon': False, 'date': 'Aug 13, 2022'}",0,,,"This is an ancient and interesting merge type game<br />
<br />
Players need to merge three tombstones (or zombies) with the same shape into a higher-level tombstone<br />
<br />
When all the squares on the chessboard are full, the game ends and you will get a gold coin reward according to the points<br />
<br />
If you encounter difficulties and cannot merge, you can try to use the round universal merge, or use a bomb.<br />
<br />
<br />
At present, the game is offered to fans as a free product. Therefore, the option to buy gold coins in the game is unlimited (cheating). If you are confused about the difficulty of the game, you can directly buy gold coins in the game for free, and then use gold coins to buy props for customs clearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, we have retained some 'back doors' of the game<br />
<br />
1. Using the right mouse button in the chess board of the game can directly upgrade the object pointed by the mouse<br />
<br />
2. Press keypad 1, and then press the left mouse button to automatically generate a zombie<br />
<br />
3. Pressing keypad 2 and then the left mouse button will blow up the object pointed by the mouse<br />
<br />
4. Pressing the L key on the keyboard will delete all the contents on the chessboard<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also try to use this series of commands to construct an 'interesting' level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ten years ago, we were trying to make independent games. Unfortunately, the environment was poor at that time, and piracy was rampant. After the game came out, the prison break version was soon released, and the free version was overwhelming. So the game died.<br />
<br />
Ten years later, after a lot of things, the game has seen the light of the day again. In order to give back to our friends who insisted on supporting us in those years, and to leave footprints in the dusty past, this commemorative version of the game is specially launched for pure commemoration. The comments on this game will be taken into account in the subsequent reproduction products.<br />
<br />
This game is developed with unity3d 3.5.6, and written with ngui and uscript plug-in visual programming. Now the plug-in has disappeared, and this work is also the masterpiece of this plug-in.","This is an ancient and interesting merge type game<br />

<br />
In the year 2310 people on Earth discovered a new way to cure all deadly diseases. By 2315 the technology reached Russia. The point of this medical procedure was to replace patient’s blood with mercury. In the first years only the richest could afford it, but сlandestine clinics that provided blood replacement services for little money gradually emerged. At the same time, the number of ordinary people who contracted incurable diseases grew bigger and bigger and the mercury treatment no longer helped them. Soon it became clear that being around «mercuries», that’s how people who passed the transfusion were called, is dangerous. As a result, the world government introduced a complete ban on mercury operations, special police units of hunters were created, who sought out and eliminated mercury people. But the politicians and the rich continued to carry out transfusions. In the end, all this led to civil riots. <br />
<br />
The law enforcement sided with people and all mercuries were gathered and sent off to Mars. Earth was ruled by the police government. Mars was divided into two zones - the outer zone, to where the poor who had procedures in the сlandestine clinics were sent, and the inner zone where former cream of society lived. Since the inner zone was organized by the politicians themselves and not policemen, it was heavily guarded against any intrusion attempts, and it was possible to get there only for a huge amount of money after passing the loyalty test. If less than a month had passed since the transfusion, mercuries were sent to the outer zone. If more than a month had passed, then mercuries were accused of concealing their status and were liquidated. Substandard procedures and lack of normal air on Mars led to the fact that people began to mutate in the outer zone and turned into horrible monsters. Nevertheless, the mercuries who were caught on Earth by hunters were sent there. You were one of those hunters…<br />
